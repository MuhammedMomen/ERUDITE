## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Erudite derived from the realization of the challenges individuals face during the job search process. Recognizing the need for a more easy and personalized approach, so I had envisioned an AI-powered solution that could empower job seekers with tailored guidance and support.

## What it does

Erudite is an AI-powered job seeker application based on Gemini Pro AI from Google, designed to assist users throughout their career journey. It gathers data from users, including their CV, preferences, and targeted job titles, to provide personalized recommendations and insights. Users can explore job opportunities, receive tailored advice, and gain valuable insights.

## How it was built

Erudite was built in Python language and exploited the Gemini Pro model from Google as the (LLM) large language model to role-play the AI consultant, and LangChain framework for orchestrating the data flow from the user input to the response from the LLM. Moreover, Beautiful-Soup framework for some publicly posted jobs data scrapped to be fed to the model as a knowledge base. Finally, FLET framework that uses flutter concepts but in python and was used for putting things together in a modern-looking UI.
