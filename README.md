## Erudite: Your AI Job Seeker Companion

Erudite is an innovative AI-driven application designed to revolutionize the job search experience. With simple UI and exploiting Google Pro Gemini AI  to add GenAI feature, Erudite aims to empower job seekers with personalized guidance and support throughout their career advancements.


## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Erudite derived from the realization of the challenges individuals face during the job search process. Recognizing the need for a more easy and personalized approach, so I had envisioned an AI-powered solution that could empower job seekers with tailored guidance and support.

## What it does

Erudite is an AI-powered job seeker application based on Gemini Pro AI from Google, designed to assist users throughout their career journey. It gathers data from users, including their CV, preferences, and targeted job titles, to provide personalized recommendations and insights. Users can explore job opportunities, receive tailored advice, and gain valuable insights.

## How it was built

Erudite was built in Python language and exploited the Gemini Pro model from Google as the (LLM) large language model to role-play the AI consultant, and LangChain framework for orchestrating the data flow from the user input to the response from the LLM. Moreover, Beautiful-Soup framework for some publicly posted jobs data scrapped to be fed to the model as a knowledge base. Finally, FLET framework that uses flutter concepts but in python and was used for putting things together in a modern-looking UI.

## Challenges faced:

Developing Erudite posed several challenges, as I am not a programmer in the first place and was just starting to play with the code based on some basic knowledge and getting some help in coding from Google Gemini.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

Despite the challenges, I am proud to have created Erudite as I initially imagined, a robust and innovative solution that addresses the complexities of the job search process. it might provide a new way of assisting job seekers and might boost revenues for recruitment agencies if they adopted such an idea to integrate as a built-in service.

## What I learned

Building Erudite has provided me with valuable insights into AI development, data integration, user experience design, and prompt engineering as I had implemented the **RAG technique**.

## What's next for Erudite

Looking ahead, I plan to further enhance Erudite's capabilities by integrating additional features such as a wider search range including more websites, skill development recommendations, more insights to be added for the insights tab including geospatial info insights, and personalized summary for all job descriptions found.
